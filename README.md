How viruses Spread

Trojans masquerading as useful programs are a source of viruses infecting your computer.

The main ways to distribute your Trojan:

1) Protroyan gamer: Go to the gaming forum, well, or a blog where you can leave comments and glue your Trojan with cheats, as they say the profit is good, because gamers turn off their antivirus.

2) The same thing, but gluing with cracks, again comments on forums, torrent trackers, etc. The coverage is great, maybe as they say.

3)  Varez music and clips, here the method is quite simple, a shortcut is made, like music / playlist, etc. for example, it runs it, and instead of it the Trojan is launched, well, of course, music / movie can also be launched to divert your eyes. The main thing is to mask your virus so that no one thinks that this is an executable file that will launch the shortcut.

4) Distribution by mail with the extension .src, you can spam by mail like there: "You got an invoice!"

5) Extensions like doc.exe are used less often, but everything is clear here, this is spam for soap, etc.

6) Another good way, this is a miracle program for hacking VKontakte, etc., there are many victims in general.

7) Phishing sites, such as update adob, chrome, etc.

8) Well, the last way, trample the hacker, go for a hack. board and put a cryptor, a stealer, etc. there. with a fucker, you can both in the build and in the builder. In the latter case, someone else will do the job for you. UPD This article was created for informational purposes only. If we missed something, add it in the comments.
